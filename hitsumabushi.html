        <p>What is Hitsumabushi?</p>
        <p>Unagi Chazuke (Hitsumabushi) is a popular rice bowl from Nagoya which features broiled eel on top of the steamed rice.
        Piping hot broth is poured on the rice to enjoy. It’s perfect comfort food on a busy weeknight.</p>

        <p>Chazuke (鰻茶漬け) is one of Mr. JOC’s favorite dishes. Before we were married, the only unagi dish he knew was Unagi Don
        (Unadon/Broiled Eel over Rice). After I introduced Unagi Chazuke to him, he loved it so much that he only requests this
        dish whenever we buy unagi. It’s a light and comforting dish that can be prepared easily on a busy weeknight!
        The rice bowl is very alike to Hitsumabushi (櫃まぶし), a specialty dish from Nagoya prefecture. I will talk about the
        differences between the two in today’s post.

        <h2>Ingredients &  Percentages</h2>
        <p>
            .
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups dashi</li>
            <li>2 tsp kobucha</li>
            <li>1 fillet unagi (eel)</li>
            <li>2-3 tbs unagi sauce</li>
            <li>2 serving cooked Japanese short-grain rice</li>
            <li>1 green onion/scallion(optional)</li>
            <li>1 sprig mitsuba</li>
            <li>1 tsp toasted white sesame seeds</li>
            <li>Japanese sansho pepper</li>

    <div class="howto">
        <h2> Gather all the ingredients.</h2>
        <p> Here is a brief process of how to make Hitsumabushi from scratch.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>In a small saucepan, combine dashi and konbucha.</li>
            <li>Heat the broth over medium heat and whisk well. Taste the broth and adjust with more konbucha or salt if necessary.</li>
            <li>Cut unagi in half (or maybe third) to fit inside your serving bowls.</li>
            <li>Line the baking sheet with parchment paper. Place unagi on top. WITHOUT preheating, put the baking sheet in the middle
            rack of your oven, and broil on high for 7 minutes (no need to flip).</li>
            <li>After 7 minutes or so, take it out and brush the unagi Sauce over the fillet. Broil for another 30 to 60 seconds until
            you see bubbles on top of unagi.</li>

        </ol>
        <h4>To serve</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the mitsuba and green onion into small pieces.</li>
            <li>Serve steamed rice in bowls and brush unagi sauce on the rice. Place unagi on top. You can cut Unagi into 1-inch pieces
            (easier to eat with chopsticks). Pour/brush more unagi sauce, if you like.</li>
            <li>Right before you serve, pour the broth over the unagi and garnish with green onions, mitsuba, and sesame seeds. You can
            sprinkle Japanese sansho pepper which gives more peppery, citrus flavor. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
