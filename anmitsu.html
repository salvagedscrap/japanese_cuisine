            <h1>Anmitsu</h1>

            <p>What is Anpan?</p>
            <p>There is a similar dessert called “Mitsu Mame”. The difference between Anmitsu and Mitsumame is the topping; either An(sweet Azuki bean paste) or mame (beans). I don’t like the particular mame used in Mitsumame because it is kind of a hard cooked mame and not sweet but rather tasteless. I always picked them all out, so I usually make Anmitsu.

            <p>There are many variations of Anmitsu depending on what else it is topped with. If you top with fruit, it is called Fruit
            anmitsu; with fresh cream it will be called cream anmitsu; with Shiratama dango it will be called shiratama anmitsu; and
            with fruit and shiratama it will be fruit shiratama anmitsu and so on……

            <p>I also spent a bit to add canned mandarin too. It was very special treat I could have when I was child. My mother only
            allowed us to have this mandarin when I and my two little sisters were sick. Those little canned mandarins were so
            deliciously cold and refreshing when I had high fever and could not eat anything but something cold. It has been too hot
            so I treated myself and spent about A$6 for a small tin and cut the apple into rabbit shape just for myself.

                Once you’ve gathered all the ingredients and toppings, just assemble them in a bowl. Kanten jelly itself does not have
                much taste so you need to pour brown sugar syrup called “Kuromitsu”. If you can’t get this kuromitsu, you can replace it
                with Hachi (bee) Mits u(syrup), aka honey, or make your own Kuromitsu.
