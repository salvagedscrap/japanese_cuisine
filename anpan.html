    <h1>Anpan</h1>

    <p>What is Anpan?</p>
    <p>Anpan is soft and moist Japanese milk bread filled with sweet bean paste called “An” or “Anko”. Japanese call bread
    “pan” which is derived from Portuguese pao or pain (bread). So An-Pan literally means sweet bean bread. It is pronounced
    An Pan. Japanese people young and elderly love Anpan and every Japanese bakery sell Anpan with their original recipes.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Soft and Moist Japanese Bread</h2>

    <p>There is an Anpan speciality bakery in Ginza, Tokyo called Kimuraya. It is my favourite Anpan shop. Whenever I go to
    Tokyo, I make sure I get anpan from this bakery. Their Anpan is made from Sakadane (Sake yeast cultured in koji rice
    malt) which is so unique to Japan. It would be difficult to attempt this special version, for obtaining the necessary
    ingredients would not be easy. However, do not despair as there is another way to make Japanese bread deliciously soft
    and moist.
    </p>

    <p>That is the Yudane method that I mentioned in my Shokupan Japanese Milk Bread Recipe post. Yudane is a mixture of bread
    flour and boiling hot water. The hot water gelatinises the starch in the flour which takes in more water thus making it
    soft and also increases the sweetness of the bread. If you are interested in the Yudane method, read more in my
    Shokupan, Japaneses milk bread post.

    <h2>Ingredients & Baker’s Percentage for the Bread</h2>
    <p>
    Anpan is unique to Japan though most ingredients you should be able to get without much trouble. I also included baker’s
    percentage in the brackets.
    <ul>
        <li>Bread Flour – Flour forms the structure of bread. It absorbs moisture and supports bread expansion. The percentage of
         protein affects the texture of the bread. I used bread flour that has around 12-13% protein. Yudane 50g (17%) + 250g
        (83%) = 100%</li>
        <li>Milk 120ml (40%)</li>
        <li>Egg – I used one large egg which weighs about 50g (17%)</li>
        <li>Sugar 25g (8%)</li>
        <li>Salt 4g (1%)</li>
        <li>Unsalted butter 40g (13%)</li>
        <li>Instant dry yeast – I used Saf-instant Gold 3g (1%)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Make Anpan Bread?</h2>
<p> Here is a brief process of how to make Anpan bread from scratch.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Soak dry beans: Soak dry beans 2 nights before baking Anpan. It requires soaking overnight.</li>
        <li>Make sweet bean paste & yudane: See how to make sweet bean paste and Yudane by clicking the links.</li>
        <li>Divide the sweet bean paste and make the bread dough: Divide the sweet bean paste into 12 equal-sized balls. Make bread dough either using a stand mixer, bread machine or hand kneading. Place the dough in a lightly oil sprayed large bowl and let the dough rise till double the size.</li>
        <li>Wrap the sweet paste bean balls with bread dough and shape. Divide the bread dough into equal-sized 12 balls. Flatten
        them and place the sweet bean paste balls in the centre. Wrap the sweet bean paste balls with bread dough and seal.</li>
        <li>Second proofing Cover the dough with a well wrung out damp kitchen cloth (to avoid the bread dough drying out) for about 20- 30 minutes. Start to preheat the oven to 356°F (180°C)</li>
        <li>Bake for about 20 minutes Bake them in preheated oven for about 20 minutes. Remove from the tin (if you used one as I
        did) and cool the bread on a cooling wire rack.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>A Tip to Shape Your Anpan</p>
    <p> They are usually just round buns, though I wanted to make them a little taller and cuter so I used a muffin mold to
    shape. So when I wrapped the sweet bean paste with bread dough, I placed them in a muffin tin. If you don’t have one,
    just second proof without putting them in a muffin tin. One important tip I can give you is that when wrapping the bean
    paste ball, the dough gathers at the top (which becomes the bottom part of bun) and this tends to become thicker. In
    order to make the dough a uniform thickness, when rolling it out, make the centre part a little thicker than the edge.</p>
