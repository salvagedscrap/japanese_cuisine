            <p>What is Sapporo Soup Curry?</p>
            <p>Originated in Sapporo, Hokkaido, a northernmost island of Japan, Soup Curry is a light curry-flavored soup served with
            fall-off-the-bone chicken and colorful vegetables that are flash-fried to give the vibrant colors. It’s relatively a new
            addition to the popular Japanese curry scene.</p>

            <p>Most notably known as the birthplace of the oldest beer in Japan, Sapporo, the capital of Hokkaido, is also a food
            lover’s paradise. You can find incredibly fresh seafood, seasonal vegetables from local farms, and high-quality dairy
            products, all of which contribute to its thriving food scene.
            </p>
            <p>
            Aside from the famous soft-serve ice cream, snow crab, and jingisu kan (barbecue-style mutton dish), another local
            specialty that any visitors to the snowy city must-try is Soup Curry (スープカレー). Served piping hot and filled with
            nutritious ingredients and flavorful spices, this amazing curry dish is one of the best cure-alls on a cold, snowy day, or any day when your curry craving hits.

            <h2> Gather all the ingredients.</h2>
            <p> Here is a brief process of how to make Hitsumabushi from scratch.</p>
    
            <ol>
                <li>Rinse rice and drain well. Place rice and water in the inner pot of the cooker. Close the lid.</li>
                <li>HeSelect [Rice] using [MENU] button and set the steam time to 8 minutes. Press [COOK] button. When cooking is completed,
                warming will start. Fluff up the rice with a rice scooper. Tip: Adjust cooking time and water according to personal
                taste.</li>
                <li>Once we start cooking, we don't have time to measure, so make sure to prepare the seasonings ahead of time (1 piece
                Japanese curry roux, 1 Tbsp curry powder, 1 tsp garam masala, 1 Tbsp tomato paste, 1 ½ Tbsp mango chutney, and 1 Tbsp
                honey).</li>
                <li>Dice the onion (It doesn’t have to be perfect).</li>
                <li>Cut the carrot into small pieces. I recommend using the "rangiri" Japanese cutting method to increase the surface. It’ll
                help cooking evenly and faster⅔, and absorbing more flavors.</li>
                <li>Mince the garlic and grate the ginger.</li>
                <li>Pat dry the chicken with paper towel to remove any moisture. Season the chicken with kosher salt and freshly ground
                black pepper.</li>
    
            </ol>
            <h4>To Stir Fry</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Set cooker to [BROWNING FRY, level 6] for 30 minutes (you can add more minutes later on if you need extra time).</li>
                <li>Heat 1 Tbsp oil and brown the chicken, skin side down, for 5 minutes each side, or until golden brown. Don’t crowd the
                pot and brown the chicken in batches, if necessary.</li>
                <li>After the bottom side is nicely brown, flip to cook the other side. Then transfer the chicken to a plate and continue
                with the next batch. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Add the diced onion and 1 Tbsp unsalted butter. Sauté until translucent, about 7-8 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and mix all together. Add 1 piece Japanese curry roux, 1 Tbsp curry powder, and 1 tsp garam masala. Give it a quick stir. Add 1 Tbsp tomato paste and sauté until fragrant. Add 1 Tbsp honey and 1 ½ Tbsp mango chutney and mix all together.</li>
                <li>Gradually add half the chicken broth, scraping the brown bits on the bottom of the pot. Transfer the chicken back to the
                pot. Add the carrots, shimeji mushrooms, and the rest of chicken broth. Add the carrots, shimeji mushrooms, and the rest of chicken broth.</li>
                <li>Close the lid and set cooker to [MULTI COOK, level 9] for 35 minutes. For Instant Pot directions, see Notes.</li>
                <li>Once the pressure cooking is done, open the lid and stir. Add 1 tsp kosher salt and 1 tsp soy sauce.</li>
                <li>Taste and adjust the flavor.</li>
            </ol>
    
    
        </div>
        <div class="finaltip">
            <p>Notes</p>
            <p>Instant Pot users: Use [Saute] mode to brown the chicken. Then for pressure cooking, set to [Manual, High Pressure] for
            15 minutes. Make sure the steam release handle points at “sealing” and not “venting”. Expect pressure cooking takes
            10-15 minutes to reach pressure before the cooking program starts, and another 15-25 minutes to naturally release
            pressure. When the pot is ⅔ of the way full, I highly recommend natural release.</p>
